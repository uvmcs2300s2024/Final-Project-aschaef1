# Final Project: Boids
## Alexander Schaefer

I reused code from the screensavers project to start the final project object instantiation.
All that should be required to run the program is to run main.cpp.
I have met all of my objectives for this assignment, and as such, think it is worth the full 100 points.
I've run the project on Windows 11.
### A synopsis of the program
I have created a functioning boids simulation with code implementations for
seperation, alignment, cohesion, and obstacle avoidance from boids of any other color
and from the border of the screen.
